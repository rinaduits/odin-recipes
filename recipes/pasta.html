        <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Traditionally a mortar and pestle</strong> is used for a rustic chunky Trapanese pesto. It’s best to follow the order of when the ingredients are added to make the blending easier</li>
            <li><strong>You can however use a small food processor</strong>  or blender but ensure not to over blend the pesto and only pulse it so you still have a rustic texture. *Note the blender will create more of a thin watery consistency due to the tomato juices </li>
            <li><strong>Use good quality fresh ingredients</strong>  for the best flavor. As there are only a few ingredients in this pesto sauce, trust me it makes a huge difference</li>
            <li><strong>Don't add the pesto to the hot pan!</strong> It’s supposed to be served fresh for the best flavor</li>
            <li><strong>Keep some of the pasta cooking water</strong> and add a splash if needed, when the pesto is added to the cooked pasta</li>
        </ol>
